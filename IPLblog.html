            Great winning on the last ball, And an incredile feeling to finish it off.Maxi and I juist kept telling each other to watch that ball till the end.
            I wasn't nervous at any point and I was just looking for the right ball and the opportunity to hit it out. I have worked hard and nothing comes easy.
            This will give us a lot of confidence.</em>

          <p>  <em>
            Unbelievable game , we had nothing to lose , but it was a competetive game which is always the case in the IPL. The way AB batted in the begining and then with 
        KS and Maxwell in the end was unbelievable . We thought of it the other way around this gives us the confidence that we can pull of a game from any situation
     We hav eplayed well in sharjah we have been able to hamdle the conditions and keep the opposition in check if things have gone wrong from us.
    We have the experince already and we need to utilize it as much as possible to keep moving in this tournament. </em>
